## Project background

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Setting up

* No installation required
* Locate 'index.html' in the folder directory
* Open file in the broweser of your choice


## How to play the game

* There are sixteen cards with 8 matching pairs of hidden icons
* Cards need to be flipped in order to view the hidden icons
* The player will only view the icons briefly before the cards are flipped over
* The player must match all icons to their appropriate pairing

## Game rules

* The object of the game is to match all the pairs in the deck
* The player may only open 2 cards at a time
* Match all pairs in the fastest time possible
